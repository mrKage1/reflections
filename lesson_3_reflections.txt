When would you want to use a remote repository rather than keeping all your work local?

Why might you want to always pull changes manually rather than having Git automatically stay up-to-date with your remote repository?
No need to push every commit to GitHub. Instead I can do everything offline and push them when I get online.

Describe the differences between forks, clones, and branches. When would you use one instead of another?
to fork - to make a copy of the repo only on GitJub. (Example: Jon's repo to your account.)
to clone - make a copy: from GitHub to your local computer
branch - is a branch of a repo
