What happens when you initialize a repository? Why do you need to do it?
I create empty repo. Then I can add files to track history.

How is the staging area different from the working directory and the repository? What value do you think it offers?
On staging area we add/remove files that are in our working repository to/from repository.

How can you use the staging area to make sure you have one commit per logical change?
I can do
git diff --staged
to ensure I editet needed files and added them to this commit.

What are some situations when branches would be helpful in keeping your history organized? How would branches help?
In branches I can create, test... develop some experimental or new features.

How do the diagrams help you visualize the branch structure?
I can see branches structure, which commits were made on every branch etc.

What is the result of merging two branches together? Why do we represent it in the diagram the way we do?
This way we add new features or etc to our master branch.

What are the pros and cons of Gitâ€™s automatic merging vs. always doing merges manually?
Automatic - fast and easy, but not always works.
